Just some tincture in time
mix it with wine
bubble it up in my head
Feelin' the glow
there’s something you should know…
Forgive me if it bleeds into red

Bask in the sun
comin’ undone
reachin’ that golden spot
Loosen the grip
I ain’t wastin no trip
Wishin’ I was somewhere I’m not

Nobody knows
why the shape of those toes
are scooped like a backyard shovel
They’ve been there since birth
just a distal girth
Why do they look so befuddled?

Bask in the sun
comin’ undone
reachin’ that golden spot
Loosen the grip
I ain’t wastin no trip
Wishin’ I was somewhere I’m not

The time in between
coffee and dreams
Pixelated. Staccato.
Now I’m just fine
with some tincture in time
Excuse me 
while I pour another

Bask in the sun
comin’ undone
reachin’ that golden spot
Loosen the grip
I ain’t wastin no trip
Wishin’ I was somewhere I’m not
