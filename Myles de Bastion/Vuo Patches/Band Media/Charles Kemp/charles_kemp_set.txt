---- Nothin’ But Heartache ----

Nothin’ but heart-ache
Nothin’ to be known
Nothin’ but heart-ache
Nothin’ to be shown

Nothin’ but filters 
Ride upon the sea
Drowning like cellophane
High up in a tree

Nothin’ but heart-ache
Nothin’ to be known
Nothin’ but heart-ache
Nothin’ to be shown

Nothin’ but cancer
On the sea of green
Dying like melodies
So far yet to be seen

Nothin’ but heart-ache
Nothin’ to be known
Nothin’ but heart-ache
Nothin’ to be shown

Nothin’  but whispers 
Silenced on their own
Nothin’ but sorrow 
To melt a heart of stone

Nothin’ but filters
Ride upon the sea
Drowning like cellophane
High up in a tree


Exit (lights pink to red to purple to blue to black)
----------------
But what is this, no
I should have known, love
That you’d desert me 
Now I know that you are gone now
That you are gone now
That you are gone now 

And I’d hate for you to miss what I have done now
What I have done now
What I have done now

And it’s too strong and too late for you to come now
For you to come now
For you to come down
For you to come down
For you to come down
For you to come down.


MY CONFESSION (BLOOD AT THE ROOT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First Verse
---------------
Stuck on a road
Fire in the silence of me
End of it all 
Blood at the root of the tree
The further we fall
Dead in the arms of the free
That’s how it had to be
That’s how it had to be

Second Verse
-------------------
Out on the road
Finally I find what I see
Nothing at all
Dead in the dark of the sin
The further we fall
Damn me to spite my own skin
Oh what a mess I’m in
Oh what a mess i’m in

Third Verse
----------------
Figure it out 
Sign with doubt
Have a plan
Be a man
Second guess
Oh what a mess
I must confess
Oh what a mess
I must confess
Oh what a mess
I must confess
I must confess
I must confess


GREEN
--------------

First Verse
------------------
Softly 
I began to whisper
Softly on my own 
Deadly
Split between the silence
Crying all alone

Second Verse
----------------------
Trying
Hard to find an answer
Searching for control
Ending
Or is it beginning?
Darkness in my soul.

Third Verse
----------------
Rings of
Smoke comes my direction
Pulling
Me along
Fragrant
Green beneath the window
Carrying me home


Fourth Verse
-------------------
Buried 
Deep within the memories
Of the days I’d hold
Your hand
In mine
And we’d 
Dance under the pale moon-light

Fifth Verse
-----------------
Green
Dark under the moon-light
Buried in a hole
Lies the 
Truth of my resistance
Shrouded in my soul


Exit
---------
And there is only green

















LOVE’S LABOUR’S LOST
-----------------------------------------------

Intro
-----------------
Come down and I will be your life
And we could raise two kids
And you would be my wife
We’ve got nothin’ to lose
There is nothing to prove

Chorus
------------------
Oh I was your lover
And you were my friend
And we stood for each other
Said we’d fight till the end

First Verse
----------------
And we walked on Sundays 
Down by the old road
And no one could tell me
Just where this road goes

Bridge
----------------
Why 
shouldn’t I complain?
It’s not the same
Who should I blame?
And where
Am I to go?
The is a hole
Deep in my soul

Chorus
------------------
Oh I was your lover 
And you were my friend
And we stood for each other
Said we’d fight till the end
Second Verse
-------------------
A life lived in silence
A life full of lies
Of dark and deluded dreams
Cloud face in the sky

Third Verse
-----------------
What happened to yesterday?
They’ve left and they’ve gone away
There’s nothing that’s left to say.
Could of left you
Didn’t have to stay

Exit
----------------
Lies and desperate silences
That pulls us ever on
























IN TIME WITH YOU
----------------------------------

First Verse
-----------------

Isn’t it funny?
Isn’t in grand?
Is it the sun light on you face?

Are you a whisper?
Are you the sea?
Is it your hair that blows the wind in me?



Second Verse
-------------------
I carried you with me
All through the rain
You kept me away from all the pain

What was between us?
What did they see?
Where were the signs 
That we weren’t meant to be?




Third Verse
--------------------
What could it be?
What would we see?
Will there be something good
For you and me?

We once had each other
Now there are three
Only the future is 
Ours to see

MAYBE
-------------



First Verse
---------------
Farthest from my mind?
Maybe
Did I cross a line?

Farthest from my mind?
Maybe 
Could I see the sign?


Second Verse
----------------------
Farthest from the edge ?
Maybe
Did I come undone?

Was it something said?
Maybe
Did we touch the sun?
Did we touch the sun?


Third Verse
---------------------
Something in my head?
Maybe
Forever left unseen

Better left unsaid?
Maybe
Is that the way it should be?
That’s not the way it should be




First Bridge
------------
In your eyes
I see you and me
Holding hands
Telling lies 
Dancing cheek to cheek

When you touch the scence 
I will be
I will find you looking 
Back to me






Second Bridge
-----------------
And Please 
Don’t tell me stay
Couldn’t take it anyway
Should have left yesterday

And Please
Don’t cry anymore
Should have been here before
Could have walked out that door












Fourth Verse
-----------------
To think that we are done 
Maybe
We’ve only just begun

What we have found once was 
Maybe
Was better left unsung


Fifth Verse
----------------
‘Till the end of time
Maybe
‘Till the end of days

Only emptiness
Maybe
There’s nothing left to say


WHAT KIND OF LOVE
-----------------------------------

What 
What Kind of Love
Could be real 
In a dream?

And what 
What could be said
Without love 
Endlessly?
 
And what
What could be done 
Without love
Without you?

THE LAST UNICORN
-----------------------------

First Verse
--------------
When the last eagle flies 
Over the last crumbling mountain
And the last lion roar 
At the last dusty fountain

In the shadow of the forest
Though she may be old and worn
There will stare
Unbelieving 
At the last unicorn



Second Verse
------------------
When the first breath of winter
Through the flowers is icing 
And you look to the north
And a pale moon is rising

And it seems like all is dying
And would leave the world to mourn
In the distance
Hear the laughter 
Of the last unicorn

I’m a Alive
I’m a Alive





Third Verse
---------------
When the last moon is cast
Over the last star of morning
And the future has past
Without even a last desperate warning

And you look into the sky
Where through the clouds a path is torn
Look and see her how she sparkles 
It’s the last unicorn

I’m Alive
I’m Alive





























I CAN’T HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wise men say 
Only fools rush in
But I can’t help falling in love with you
Shall I stay 
Would it be a sin
If I can’t help falling in love with you

Like a river flows 
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand, 
Take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling in love with you

Like a river flows 
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand,
Take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling in love with you
For I can’t help falling in love with you


















HELLO
----------
 
First Verse
---------------
Hello, it’s me
I was wondering if after all these years you’d like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time’s supposed to heal ya
But I ain’t done much healing


Second Verse
--------------------
Hello, can you hear me?
I’m in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I’ve forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There’s such a difference between us 
And a million miles

Chorus
-------------

Hello from the other side
I must of called a thousand times
To tell you I’m sorry for everything that I’ve done
But when I can you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I’ve tried
To tell you I’m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don’t matter. It clearly doesn’t tear you apart anymore







Third Verse
--------------------

Hello, how are you?
It’s so typical of me to talk about myself. I’m sorry
I hope that you’re well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

And it’s no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Chorus
------------
So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I’m sorry for everything that I’ve done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I’ve tried
To tell you I’m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don’t matter. It clearly doesn’t tear you apart anymore


Bridge
------------
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore


Chorus
---------
 hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I’m sorry for everything that I’ve done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I’ve tried
To tell you I’m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don’t matter. It clearly doesn’t tear you apart anymore


O HOLY NIGHT
--------------------------------
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine




















SILENT NIGHT
------------------------------

Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright.
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child.
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace

Optional verses:

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight.
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night!
Son of God love's pure light.
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
 





 
 





SPACE ODDITY
----------------------------------

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, 
engines on
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you

[spoken]
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

Here am I floating 
round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do.






BEHIND BLUE EYES
-----------------------------

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams
They aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams
They aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

If I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
If I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes








DANNY BOY
-------------------

Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so
