Who bears the weight
Of infinite miles
beat upon their chest
penultimate denial

I wore that weight
Until she said "my child"
Beware the false self
And fake smiles

salvation
it was worth it all
amelioration
broke the fall

but the stone wore down
made a path of sand
let me to a crown
at the end of the land

salvation
it was worth it all
amelioration
broke the fall

Salvation
It was worth it
Palpitations
For one second of bliss
