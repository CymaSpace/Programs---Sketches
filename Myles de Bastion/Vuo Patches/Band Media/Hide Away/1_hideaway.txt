Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back,
just want to shout out,
give me more

You're just a hideaway,
you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control,
what's going on?

But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more

Ooh, aah, aah, ooh, ooh, aah, aah, ooh, ooh, aah, aah, ooh, ooh, aah, aah, ooh

You send me the shiver up my spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge of letting go

You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Putting my head into the clouds I'm floating home
When you get me going I can't find a way to stop

You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

Ooh, aah, aah, ooh, ooh, aah, aah, ooh

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Hide away with me some more

Bringing me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just wanna shout out, "Give me more."

You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on

You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
You're a day that keeps me dreaming

Ooh, aah, aah, ooh, ooh, aah, aah, ooh

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Hide away with me some more
