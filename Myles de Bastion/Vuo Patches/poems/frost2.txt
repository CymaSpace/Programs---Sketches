TO THE THAWING WIND 

Come with rain, O loud Southwester! 
Bring the singer, bring the nester
Give the buried flower a dream
Make the settled snow-bank stream
Find the brown beneath the white
But whate'er you do to-night, 
Bathe my window, make it flow 
Melt it as the ice will go
Melt the glass and leave the sticks 
Like a hermit's crucifix
Burst into my narrow stall
Swing the picture on the wall
Run the rattling pages o'er
Scatter poems on the floor
Turn the poet out of door.
