SAT ACADEMY
Attempted to establish a partnership but found they did not provide accessibility services.  Revisiting partnership and working with them to provide accessibility services.  Working with staff member internally to determine their status.  Will reach out to Chad Ludwig, President at OAD to assist them with compliance.

ADVOCACY
Sat Acad partnership is secondary.Mainly a way to open educational opportunities for Deaf youth in Portland and connect us to other organizations and advocates in the Deaf community.

WORKSHOP DRYRUN
Schedule a few short workshops so as to establish a track record and gain feedback about program.  Practice registration, surveys, evaluations, data collection and entry, financials, get video for marketing.  Need to prove we can effectively run a program in order to get funding and be seen as legitimate.  Need to test our evaluations to see if they are realistic, effective, and not a bureaucratic burden as we need to show we are reaching stated goals and benefiting the communities we are serving.
